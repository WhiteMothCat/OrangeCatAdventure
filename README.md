## About the game ðŸ“–

### Game tutorial

- __WASD__ keys for movement.
- __ENTER__ for attacking, interacting (dialogues or NPCs) and selecting in menu.
- __P__ to pause the game.
- __C__ to see the character stats.
- __Protip:__ if ENTER and W are both pressed at the same time over yellow flowers the character regenerates it's life.

### Other controls for develpment only

- __T__ to see the debug messages.
- __R__ to reload the map in case it got some adjustments during the running of the game (used only for debugging).

### Future implementations

- Add an actual tutorial to the game.
- Make the _load file_ button work.

Any ideas could be proposed to add to the game.
